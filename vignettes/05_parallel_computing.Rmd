To master parallel programming in R, there are several key concepts to understand and apply effectively. Here are the main points along with code examples:

1. **Parallelizing Loops**:
   - Utilize parallel processing to distribute loop iterations across multiple cores.
   - Example using `foreach` and `%dopar%` from the `foreach` package:

```R
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)

# Set up parallel backend
cores <- 4  # Number of cores to use
cl <- makeCluster(cores)
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Parallelized loop
result <- foreach(i = 1:10, .combine = c) %dopar% {
  # Perform computations for each iteration
  i * i
}

# Stop the parallel backend
stopCluster(cl)
```

In this example, the loop iterations from 1 to 10 are distributed across four cores using `%dopar%`. Each iteration performs a computation (squaring the value) independently in parallel. The results are combined into a single vector using `.combine = c`.

2. **Parallelizing Apply Family Functions**:
   - Apply parallel processing to apply functions across multiple elements in parallel.
   - Example using `mclapply` from the `parallel` package:

```R
library(parallel)

# Set up parallel processing
cores <- 4  # Number of cores to use

# Parallelized apply function
result <- mclapply(1:10, function(x) {
  # Perform computations for each element
  x * x
}, mc.cores = cores)
```

In this example, the function `x * x` is applied to each element of the vector 1:10 using `mclapply`. The computations are performed in parallel across four cores (`mc.cores = cores`). The results are returned as a list.

3. **Shared Memory Parallelism**:
   - Utilize shared memory parallelism to improve performance for certain operations.
   - Example using the `parallel` package and `parLapply`:

```R
library(parallel)

# Set up parallel processing
cores <- 4  # Number of cores to use
cl <- makeCluster(cores)

# Parallelized lapply with shared memory
result <- parLapply(cl, 1:10, function(x) {
  # Perform computations for each element
  x * x
})

# Stop the parallel backend
stopCluster(cl)
```

In this example, `parLapply` from the `parallel` package is used to apply the function `x * x` to each element of the vector 1:10. The computations are distributed across four cores, and the results are returned as a list.

## Main Libraries

1. **`parallel`**:
The `parallel` package is a core package in R that provides support for parallel computing. It offers functions for parallelizing computations using shared memory or distributed computing.

| - Built-in package with R, so no additional installation required. <br> - Provides various functions for parallel computing, such as `mclapply()`, `parLapply()`, and `clusterApply()`. <br> - Supports both shared memory and cluster parallelism. | - Requires manual setup and management of parallel backends. <br> - Limited support for more advanced parallel programming concepts. |

```R
library(parallel)

# Parallelized computation using mclapply()
result <- mclapply(1:10, function(x) {
  x * x
}, mc.cores = 4)
```

2. **`foreach`**:
The `foreach` package provides a higher-level interface for parallel programming in R. It simplifies the process of parallelizing loops and applying functions in parallel.

result <- foreach(i = 1:10, .combine = c) %dopar% {
  i * i
}
```

3. **`future`**:
The `future` package introduces a unified framework for asynchronous and parallel computing in R. It allows seamless switching between sequential and parallel execution, supporting multiple parallel backends.
