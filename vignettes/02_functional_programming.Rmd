Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. The main functional programming concepts in R include:

1.  **First-class and higher-order functions**: In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. R supports first-class and higher-order functions, allowing you to create and manipulate functions dynamically.

``` r
# Assigning a function to a variable
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
my_function <- add

# Passing a function as an argument
apply_function <- function(func, a, b) {
  func(a, b)
}
result <- apply_function(add, 3, 5)

# Returning a function from a function
create_multiplier <- function(factor) {
  function(x) {
    x * factor
  }
}
double <- create_multiplier(2)
result <- double(5)  # Returns 10
```

2.  **Pure functions**: A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects. In R, pure functions are preferred in functional programming as they help avoid unexpected changes to variables and facilitate reasoning about the behavior of the program.

``` r
# Pure function example
square <- function(x) {
  x * x
}
result <- square(3)  # Returns 9

# Impure function example (modifies a global variable)
counter <- 0
increment_counter <- function() {
  counter <<- counter + 1
}
```

3.  **Immutability**: In functional programming, immutability refers to the concept that once a value is assigned, it cannot be modified. In R, while variables can be reassigned, functional programming encourages minimizing such changes and treating data as immutable whenever possible. Instead of modifying existing data structures, functional programming in R emphasizes creating new data structures with the desired changes.

``` r
# Creating a new data structure instead of modifying an existing one
original_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
modified_vector <- c(original_vector, 4)
```

4.  **Recursion**: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. R supports recursion, allowing you to define functions that call themselves until a specific condition is met. Recursive functions are commonly used in functional programming to solve problems that involve repetitive calculations or data traversals.

``` r
# Recursive function to calculate the factorial
factorial <- function(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    1
  } else {
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  }
}
result <- factorial(5)  # Returns 120
```

5.  **Higher-order functions**: Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results. In R, you can define higher-order functions that take functions as arguments to perform operations such as mapping, filtering, or reducing data. Higher-order functions enable the composition of functions, leading to concise and expressive code.

``` r
# Higher-order function to perform mapping
map <- function(func, values) {
  result <- vector(length = length(values))
  for (i in seq_along(values)) {
    result[i] <- func(values[i])
  }
  result
}

# Using the map function
double <- function(x) {
  x * 2
}
original_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
mapped_vector <- map(double, original_vector)  # Returns c(2, 4, 6)
```

6.  **Function composition and pipelining**: Functional programming promotes composing functions by combining them to create more complex functions. In R, you can compose functions using operators like `%>%` (pipe operator) or using function composition operators like `compose()` from the `magrittr` package. Function composition allows you to chain together multiple operations and create pipelines of functions that transform data sequentially.

``` r
library(magrittr)

# Function composition using the compose operator
add_one <- function(x) {
  x + 1
}
square <- function(x) {
  x * x
}
composed_function <- compose(square, add_one)
result <- composed_function(3)  # Returns 16

# Function pipelining using the pipe operator
result <- 3 %>% add_one() %>% square()  # Returns 16
```

By leveraging these functional programming concepts, you can write R code that is modular, reusable, and easier to reason about.

## Main tools for Functional Programming

1. **Map functions**: Functions like `lapply()`, `sapply()`, and `mapply()` allow you to apply a function to each element of a list or vector and return the results as a new list or vector.

```R
# lapply: Apply a function to each element of a list and return a new list
original_list <- list(1, 2, 3)
result <- lapply(original_list, function(x) x * 2)  # Returns a list: [[2], [4], [6]]

# sapply: Apply a function to each element of a list and return a simplified vector or matrix
original_list <- list(1, 2, 3)
result <- sapply(original_list, function(x) x * 2)  # Returns a vector: [2, 4, 6]

# mapply: Apply a function to corresponding elements of multiple vectors or lists
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vector2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
result <- mapply(function(x, y) x + y, vector1, vector2)  # Returns a vector: [5, 7, 9]
```

1. **Reduce functions**: The `Reduce()` function combines elements of a vector using a binary function. It progressively applies the function to pairs of elements, reducing them to a single result.

```R
# Reduce: Combine elements of a vector using a binary function
vector <- 1:5
result <- Reduce(function(x, y) x + y, vector)  # Returns the sum: 15
```

1. **Filter functions**: Functions like `Filter()` or `purrr::keep()` allow you to select elements from a list or vector that satisfy a given predicate function, returning a filtered subset.

```R
# Filter: Select elements from a vector that satisfy a predicate function
vector <- 1:10
result <- Filter(function(x) x %% 2 == 0, vector)  # Returns even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

3. **Function composition**: The `%>%` (pipe) operator from the `magrittr` package enables function composition and pipelining. It allows you to chain multiple functions together, with the output of one function becoming the input of the next.

```R
# Using the %>% (pipe) operator for function composition
vector <- 1:5
result <- vector %>% sum() %>% sqrt()  # Returns the square root of the sum: 2.738612
```

4. **Anonymous functions**: Anonymous functions, created using the `function()` syntax, are useful in functional programming for defining short and one-off functions that can be passed as arguments or used inline.

```R
# Creating and using an anonymous function
vector <- 1:5
result <- lapply(vector, function(x) x * 2)  # Returns a list: [[2], [4], [6], [8], [10]]
```

5. **Higher-order functions**: R supports higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Higher-order functions facilitate abstraction and enable code reusability.

```R
# Using a higher-order function to apply a function to each element of a vector
vector <- 1:5
result <- lapply(vector, function(x) x * 2)  # Returns a list: [[2], [4], [6], [8], [10]]
```

6. **Vectorized functions**: Many built-in functions in R are vectorized, meaning they can operate on entire vectors or matrices without the need for explicit loops. This aligns with the functional programming principle of operating on collections of data at once.

```R
# Using a vectorized function to operate on entire vectors
vector <- 1:5
result <- sqrt(vector)  # Returns a vector with square roots: [1, 1.414213, 1.732051, 2, 2.236068]
```

7. **Memoization**: Memoization is a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and reuses them when the same inputs are encountered again. It can be useful for optimizing performance in functional programming.

```R
# Using memoization to cache the results of a function
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return(n)
  } else {
    if (!exists("memo", envir = globalenv())) {
      memo <- c(0, 1)
    }
    if (length(memo) <= n) {
      memo[n] <- fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
    }
    return(memo[n])
  }
}

result <- fibonacci(10)  # Returns the 10th Fibonacci number: 55
```

8. **List manipulation functions**: Functions like `lapply()`, `sapply()`, and `purrr::map()` are often used to manipulate lists by applying functions to their elements, extracting specific elements, or modifying the structure.

```R
# Using lapply to modify a list structure
original_list <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
result <- lapply(original_list, function(x) x * 2)  # Returns a list: $a = 2, $b = 4, $c = 6

# Using purrr::map to extract elements from a list
original_list <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
result <- purrr::map(original_list, "a")  # Returns a list: [[1]]

# Using purrr::map to modify elements of a list
original_list <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
result <- purrr::map(original_list, ~ .x * 2)  # Returns a list: $a = 2, $b = 4, $c = 6
```

1. **Currying and partial application**: Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take one argument each. Packages like `purrr` provide utilities for currying and partial application, enabling flexible function transformations.

```R
# Using purrr::partial to create a new function with partially applied arguments
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add_10 <- purrr::partial(add, y = 10)
result <- add_10(5)  # Returns 15
```
