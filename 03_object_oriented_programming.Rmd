Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code around objects, which are instances of classes. In R, object-oriented programming is primarily implemented using S3, S4, and Reference Classes systems. Here are the main concepts of OOP in R:

1. Classes and Objects:
   - Classes define the structure and behavior of objects. They are blueprints that define the properties (attributes) and methods (functions) of objects.
   - Objects are instances of classes that hold specific values for their attributes and can perform actions using their methods.

```R
# Creating a simple class using S3 system
setClass("Person",
  slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric"),
  prototype = list(name = "John Doe", age = 30)
)

# Creating an object of the Person class
person <- new("Person", name = "Alice", age = 25)
```

2. Inheritance:
   - Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse and creating hierarchical relationships.
   - Subclasses inherit properties from their parent classes and can override or extend those properties.

```R
# Creating a subclass that inherits from the Person class
setClass("Employee", contains = "Person",
  slots = c(salary = "numeric"),
  prototype = list(salary = 5000)
)

# Creating an object of the Employee class
employee <- new("Employee", name = "Bob", age = 35, salary = 7000)
```

3. Encapsulation:
   - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods within an object, hiding the internal details and providing controlled access to the object's properties.
   - Access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected, define the visibility and accessibility of object members.

```R
# Creating a class with encapsulated properties and methods using Reference Classes
Person <- setRefClass("Person",
  fields = list(name = "character", age = "numeric"),
  methods = list(
    initialize = function(name, age) {
      name <<- name
      age <<- age
    },
    getAge = function() {
      age
    }
  )
)

# Creating an object of the Person class
person <- Person$new(name = "Jane", age = 40)
person$getAge()  # Returns 40
```

4. Polymorphism:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method or function in different ways.
   - It allows for code flexibility by enabling the use of generic functions that can behave differently based on the class of the object.

```R
# Creating a generic function that exhibits polymorphic behavior
printDetails <- function(object) {
  if (class(object) == "Person") {
    cat("Name:", object$name, "\n")
    cat("Age:", object$age, "\n")
  } else if (class(object) == "Employee") {
    cat("Name:", object$name, "\n")
    cat("Age:", object$age, "\n")
    cat("Salary:", object$salary, "\n")
  }
}

# Using the printDetails function with objects of different classes
person <- new("Person", name = "Alice", age = 25)
employee <- new("Employee", name = "Bob", age = 35, salary = 7000)

printDetails(person)   # Prints Person details
printDetails(employee) # Prints Employee details
```

These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming in R. By utilizing classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, you can design and implement complex systems that promote code organization, modularity, and reusability.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class Definition: | In R, class definitions are typically created using the S3 system, which is simpler and less formal than Python's class definitions. R's S3 classes do not enforce strict encapsulation or have built-in support for access modifiers.                                                                                          | Python uses a more formal syntax for class definitions, using the `class` keyword. It allows for the definition of attributes and methods within the class, as well as explicit access modifiers (public, private, protected).                                                                                                                                                        |
| Inheritance:      | In R, inheritance is primarily achieved using the S3 and S4 systems. S3 classes allow for basic inheritance, where subclasses can inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes. S4 classes offer a more formal and stricter approach to inheritance, allowing for multiple inheritance and method dispatch control. | Python supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from a single parent class using the `class Subclass(ParentClass)` syntax. It also supports multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes. Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine the order in which methods are called in the inheritance hierarchy.                  |
|                   |
| Encapsulation:    | R does not have built-in support for explicit access modifiers. In S3 and S4 classes, attributes and methods are typically accessed directly, without strict enforcement of encapsulation. However, R's Reference Classes provide a more encapsulated approach with support for private and public fields and methods.          | Python supports encapsulation through the use of access modifiers. By convention, attributes and methods starting with a single underscore `_` are considered private and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Attributes and methods starting with two underscores `__` are name-mangled and are considered private within the class.                             |
|                   |
| Polymorphism:     | R supports polymorphism through generic functions and method dispatch. Generic functions can have different implementations based on the class of the object passed to them. Method dispatch is based on the class of the first argument in the function call.                                                                  | Python also supports polymorphism through the use of method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method inherited from a parent class. Method overloading, on the other hand, is not supported directly in Python, but can be achieved using different argument patterns or using third-party libraries. |

## S3 vs S4 vs S6 classes


1. **S3 Classes**:
- Informal and simple object-oriented system in R.
- No formal class definitions.
- Method dispatch is based on the generic function and the class of the object being passed.
- Example:

```R
# Creating an S3 class object
person <- list(name = "Alice", age = 25)
class(person) <- "Person"

# Defining a generic function
greet <- function(person) {
  if (class(person) == "Person") {
    cat("Hello, my name is", person$name, "and I am", person$age, "years old.\n")
  } else {
    cat("Unknown person.\n")
  }
}

# Calling the generic function
greet(person)  # Prints: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

2. **S4 Classes**:
- Formal and structured object-oriented system in R.
- Class definitions are created using the `setClass()` function.
- Method dispatch is based on the formal class hierarchy.
- Supports multiple inheritance.
- Example:

```R
# Creating an S4 class
setClass("Person",
  slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric")
)

# Defining a method for the class
setMethod("greet", "Person", function(object) {
  cat("Hello, my name is", object@name, "and I am", object@age, "years old.\n")
})

# Creating an object of the class
person <- new("Person", name = "Alice", age = 25)

# Calling the method
greet(person)  # Prints: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

3. **S6 Classes**:
- A stricter and more formal object-oriented system, introduced as an extension to S4 classes.
- Class definitions are created using the `setClass()` function, with a focus on encapsulation and explicit method definition.
- Method dispatch is based on the class hierarchy and the use of generic functions created with `setGeneric()` and `setMethod()`.
- Example:

```R
# Creating an S6 class
setClass("Person",
  slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric")
)

# Defining a generic function and method
setGeneric("greet", function(object) {
  standardGeneric("greet")
})

setMethod("greet", "Person", function(object) {
  cat("Hello, my name is", object@name, "and I am", object@age, "years old.\n")
})

# Creating an object of the class
person <- new("Person", name = "Alice", age = 25)

# Calling the method
greet(person)  # Prints: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

Encapsulation:
```R
# Defining private and public slots in an S6 class
setClass("Person",
  slots = c(private_data = "character", public_data = "numeric"),
  prototype = list(private_data = "", public_data = 0),
  access = list(private_data = "private", public_data = "public")
)

# Accessing private and public slots
person <- new("Person")
person@private_data <- "Private Data"  # Accessing private slot directly is allowed
person@public_data <- 10  # Accessing public slot directly is allowed
person@private_data  # Error: Direct access to private slot 'private_data' denied
person@public_data  # Returns 10
```
